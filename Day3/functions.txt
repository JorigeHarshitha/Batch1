Functions In JavaScript
-->Functions are first citizen in JavaScript
-->Functions are object in JavaScript
Types of Functions in JavaScript:
-->Function Declaration Statement or Pure Function or Named Function
-->Function Expression
-->Higher Order Function, callback function
-->Arrow Function
-->Nested Function
-->IIFE(Immediate Invoking Function Expression)

Function Declaration Statement:
-->it is a set of instrctions or a block of code used to perform a specific task.
Syntax:-
        keyword
            |    identifier
            |       |      identifier
            |       |         |
        function fun-name (parameters, ....)
        {
        ---local-scope
        }
        fun-name(arguments, ....)
                    |data/values(data-types)
return-keyword
-->will stop execution of the function and control will be given to caller
-->hoisting is possible(we can call the function berfore fun-declaration)
-->The main purpose of using Functions in JavaScript is code reusability,write once call it multiple times.
*create a function it should perform arthmetic operation for two numbers input should be taken from the enduser.
Typecasting convert one type of data-type into another data-type by a JavaScript engine is called Implicit.
Typecasting convert one type of data-type into another data-type by a programmer is called Explicit.
create a function to find largest of 3 numbers and the input should be given from the enduser.

Function Expression:
-->Assigning function as a value to one variable is called function expression.
-->It is used to perform specific task.
-->A function without any name is called an anonomous function.
create a funtion expression to perform arthmetic operation for three numbers and find the largest number amoung three numbers and the input should be taken from the end user.

Function Programming:
-->Higher Order Function and callback Function
-->It is used to perform generic task(multiple task).
-->It can be created using function declaration Statement or function expression or arrow function.
Higher Order Function(HOF):
-->A function which accepts another function as an argument is called Higher Order Function.
callback Function:
-->A function which passed as an argument to HOF is called as callback Function
-->with the help of HOF and COF we can perform multiple tasks.
